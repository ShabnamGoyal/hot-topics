                target="_blank">familylife.com</a> <br>Money, as defined by Webster’s dictionary, is an economic tool, a
            “medium of exchange.” Thus, we trade our physical labor for paper money and then exchange our paper money
            (or credit!) for the material goods we want. But money is much more than simply an economic tool. It is also
            psychological currency that buys emotional satisfaction. Money touches the essence of who we are and stirs
            our souls in ways that few things can. In fact, there’s a sense in which money talks to part of our
            society—always by saying goodbye.
            <br /> <br />
            First, it says goodbye to the typical family who struggles to work more hours yet still spends more money
            than they’ve earned; or to family members who vainly squandered hundreds, even thousands of dollars each
            year on gambling and lottery tickets.
            Second, money says goodbye to the married: Conflicts over money are a leading cause of divorce. Money
            produces deep conflicts between husbands and wives as it exposes differences in personality, lifestyles,
            beliefs, and goals. These tensions pull on a marriage because money often reveals our most closely held
            values, and when those values are violated, many of us react forcefully.
            <br /> <br />
            Third, money says goodbye to the living: It is the leading cause of murder and a major contributor of
            depression and suicide. “Money stress blamed in 3 deaths” read the headline of an article whose graphic
            nature was exceeded only by its familiarity. “The outburst of gunfire in Reston [Va.] that left three people
            dead was the result of ‘financial stress’ in the family,” the news account began. “Police would not say what
            kind of difficulties led 40-year-old [Joe Smith] to shoot and kill his 36-year-old wife, and 7-year-old son,
            and wound his 11-year-old daughter, then take his own life.”

                target="_blank">medicalnewstoday.com</a> <br>A manufacturer creates GMOs by introducing genetic
            material, or DNA, from a different organism through a process called genetic engineering. Most currently
            available GMO foods are plants, such as fruit and vegetables.
            All foods from genetically engineered plants on sale in the United States are regulated by the Food and Drug
            Administration (FDA). They must meet the same safety requirements as traditional foods.
            There is some controversy over the benefits and risks of GMO foods. In this article, we discuss the pros and
            cons of GMO crops, taking into account their potential effects on human health and the environment.
            <br> <br />
            <b>Pros:</b>
            Manufacturers use genetic modification to give foods desirable traits. For example, they have designed two
            new varieties of apple that turn less brown when cut or bruised. The reasoning usually involves making crops
            more resistant to diseases as they grow. Manufacturers also engineer produce to be more nutritious or
            tolerant of herbicides.

            Crop protection is the main rationale behind this type of genetic modification. Plants that are more
            resistant to diseases spread by insects or viruses result in higher yields for farmers and a more attractive
            product. Genetically modification can also increase nutritional value or enhance flavor. All of these
            factors contribute to lower costs for the consumer. They can also ensure that more people have access to
            quality food.<br> <br />

            <b>Cons:</b>
            Because genetically engineering foods is a relatively new practice, little is known about the
            long-term
            effects and safety. There are many purported downsides, but the evidence varies, and the main health
            issues
            associated with GMO foods are hotly debated. Research is ongoing. This section discusses the
            evidence for a
            range of drawbacks that people often associate with GMO foods.
            1) Allergic reactions
            2) Cancer
            3) Antibacterial resistance
            4) Outcrossing

                target="_blank">ourworld.unu.edu</a> <br>According to scientist David Archer, whose research is often
            featured in the renowned Nature magazine, the C02 that we are emitting from fossil fuels today will still be
            affecting the climate in many millenia from now. His conclusion is that even though the majority of C02
            emitted from burning a single tonne of coal or oil today will be absorbed over a few centuries by the oceans
            and vegetation, approximately 25% of it will still be lingering in the atmosphere in 1,000 years, and 10%
            still remaining and impacting the climate in 100,000 years time.
            <br /> <br />
            It will then require thousands and thousands more years for its complete absorption through the natural
            climate cycle. As Archer puts it, “the climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel C02 to the atmosphere will
            last longer than Stonehenge, longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste”.
            <br /> <br />
            <b>The Copenhagen Diagnosis:</b>
            Some of this future devastation is briefly discussed in the recently updated Copenhagen Diagnosis — a report
            authored by 26 leading climate scientists with the aim of updating the world on findings since the
            publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report in 2007. According to this Copenhagen Diagnosis, regardless
            of when a peak in global emissions finally occurs, the global temperature cannot be expected to stop rising
            until several centuries later, due to the extremely long life cycle of C02.
